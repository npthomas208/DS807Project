## Data Requirements: {.smaller}

We have elected to perform analysis on an image file:

    **2. Image Data**

In an effort to expedite and remove subjectivity we selected a random image of a blue jay:

## Image Read into R as a plot: {.smaller}

```{r}
p_0
```

## Image Comparison - more to follow: {.smaller}

For image comparison we downloaded all blue jay and hammer images from OpenImages https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/download.html

... etc. total of 93 images. 40 blue jays. 53 hammers.

## Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

Purpose: Using the methods we have learned in this class, through trial and error, we will look at the usefulness of each for image analysis and classification.

`NA`s were confirmed to be absent:
```{r eval=FALSE}

```

3. Use appropriate plots for EDA, i.e., word counts for text data.

4. Do you need to scale your data or do you need dimension reduction? If so, perform a principle components analysis on a scaled, or not-scaled data depending on your needs.

- **Decision/why?**: Explain your reasoning behind your choice of the procedure, set of variables and such for the question. 

    - Explain why you use the procedure/model/variables
    - To exceed this criterion, describe steps taken to implement the procedure in a non technical way.


- **Communication of your findings**: Explain your results.

    - Explain why you think one model is better than the other.
    - To exceed this criterion, explain your model in a non technical way.


## Part 2: Clustering (20 points)

1. Develop a clustering algorithm for your data: Choose from topic models, k-means, k-medoids, hierarchical, or DBSCAN. 

2. Explain your choices on model parameters, i.e. k, eps, minpts, and communicate your results.

## Part 3: Mixture Models (20 points)

1. Apply a mixture model based clustering to your data.

2. Explain your choices on model parameters, and communicate your results.


## Part 4: Deep Learning (20 points)

1. Apply a type of neural network algorithm to your data.

2. Explain your choices on model parameters, and communicate your results.


## Part 5: Conclusion (20 points)

1. (10 points) Based on the purpose of your analysis stated in Part 1, which analysis did a good/better/satisfactory job? How do you think you can improve the analysis?

    
2. (10 points) What are your learning outcomes for this assignment? Please focus on your learning outcomes in terms of analysis, model interpretations, and R skills - it is up to you to include this part in your presentation or not.
